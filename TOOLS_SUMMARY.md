# TaskFlow - Tool Integration Summary

## 🛠 Existing Tools Overview

### 1. task-cli ⭐ (Primary Tool - Feature Complete)
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready with Enhanced UX
- **Interactive Mode**: Professional terminal interface with screen clearing
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to terminal size (5-20 items)  
- **Text Truncation**: Unicode-aware, prevents line wrapping
- **Full CRUD**: Add, edit, done, list, search, stats, undo operations
- **YAML Storage**: Reliable persistence with backup functionality
- **Shell Completion**: bash/zsh/fish support

### 2. gcalcli-to-yaml (Calendar Import)
**Status**: 🔄 Functional, Needs Integration
- Converts Google Calendar events to YAML format
- Uses existing gcalcli for data access
- Handles recurring events and scheduling

### 3. ics-to-yaml (ICS Import)  
**Status**: 🔄 Functional, Needs Integration

- Supports timezone handling
- Compatible with most calendar applications

### 4. tasks-table (Data Display)
**Status**: 🔄 Functional, Needs Integration  
- Formats task data into readable tables

## 🎯 Integration Goals

**Primary Objective**: Create unified `taskflow` CLI that combines all tools while preserving the exceptional UX of task-cli's interactive mode.

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **Zero regression** in task-cli functionality
2. **Preserve enhanced UX** (screen clearing, responsive sizing, text truncation)
3. **Unified command structure** with logical grouping
4. **Cross-tool data integration** (calendar → tasks)
5. **Maintained performance** and reliability

## 🚀 Implementation Priority

1. **HIGH**: Migrate task-cli → `taskflow task` commands
2. **MEDIUM**: Integrate calendar tools → `taskflow calendar` commands  
3. **LOW**: Add visualization → `taskflow display` commands
4. **FUTURE**: Cross-tool features (calendar sync, smart scheduling)

The existing task-cli interactive mode is the gold standard for terminal UX - this MUST be preserved and enhanced, not compromised during integration.
