# Development Session Summaries

This directory contains summaries of development sessions for the Conflux project. These summaries provide context continuity between sessions and help track the evolution of features and decisions.

## Purpose

- **Context Continuity**: Understand the full context of previous development work
- **Decision History**: Track architectural choices and rationale
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor feature implementation progress
- **Team Collaboration**: Help team members understand recent changes
- **Debugging Context**: Provide background when investigating issues

## File Naming Convention

Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`

Examples:
- `2025-09-23-image-attachments.md`
- `2025-10-01-authentication-system.md`
- `2025-10-15-performance-optimization.md`

## Session Summary Template

```markdown
# Session: [Feature/Task Name]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration**: ~X hours
**Participants**: [List of participants]
**AI Model**: [If AI assistant involved, specify model/agent name]

## Objectives
- [Primary goal 1]
- [Primary goal 2]

## Key Decisions
- [Important architectural or design decision]
- [Rationale for chosen approach]

## Implementation Summary
- [High-level overview of what was implemented]

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Create after significant sessions**: Document sessions that implement new features, fix major issues, or make architectural changes
2. **Be specific but concise**: Include enough detail for context without overwhelming
3. **Focus on decisions**: Emphasize why choices were made, not just what was done
4. **Include lessons learned**: Help future development avoid pitfalls
5. **Reference commits**: Link to relevant git commits for detailed code changes
6. **Record AI model**: If an AI assistant participated, include an `AI Model` line near the top for provenance

## Integration with Git

These summaries complement (don't replace) good git practices:
- Descriptive commit messages
- Feature branch naming
- Pull request descriptions
- Release notes

The session summaries provide higher-level context that individual commits may not capture.
