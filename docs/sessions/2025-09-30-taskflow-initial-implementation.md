# Session: TaskFlow Initial Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Duration**: ~Several hours
**Participants**: AI Model
**AI Model**: Gemini CLI

## Objectives
- Implement core task management features from `task-cli`.
- Integrate calendar functionalities from `gcalcli-to-yaml` and `ics-to-yaml`.
- Implement display and visualization features from `tasks-table`.
- Implement advanced features: smart task prioritization, task scheduling, notification system, plugin architecture, and a basic web interface.
- Implement a version command to display build information.

## Key Decisions
- Adopted `cobra` for CLI framework, `promptui` for interactive UI, `viper` for configuration, and `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` for storage.
- Prioritized preserving the interactive mode's UX from `task-cli`.
- Created a modular structure with `cmd`, `internal`, and `pkg` directories.
- Implemented a simplified internal plugin architecture for extensibility.

## Implementation Summary
Implemented the full scope of the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` document, covering core task management, calendar integration, and display features. Additionally, several advanced features from the `README.md`'s Phase 5 were implemented to enhance functionality and demonstrate extensibility.

## Technical Details
### New Components
- **`internal/config`**: Centralized configuration management using `viper`.
- **`internal/storage`**: YAML-based persistence for tasks and calendar events.
- **`internal/gcal`**: Logic for parsing `gcalcli` TSV output.
- **`internal/ics`**: Logic for parsing ICS file content.
- **`internal/table`**: Logic for rendering tasks in a formatted table using `tablewriter`.
- **`internal/plugin`**: Core plugin interface and registry for custom extensions.
- **`internal/plugins/hello`**: A dummy plugin demonstrating the plugin architecture.
- **`pkg/version`**: Package to hold application version information.

### Modified Components  
- **`main.go`**: Initialized configuration and registered plugins.
- **`cmd/root.go`**: Configured root command, added `task`, `calendar`, `display`, `notify`, `serve`, and `version` subcommands.
- **`cmd/task/*`**: Implemented `add`, `list`, `done`, `edit`, `search`, `stats`, `undo`, `config`, `completion`, `prioritize`, and `schedule` commands.
- **`cmd/calendar/*`**: Implemented `import` (gcal, ics), `list`, and `sync` commands.
- **`cmd/display/*`**: Implemented `table` command.
- **`cmd/notify.go`**: Implemented notification system for upcoming tasks and events.
- **`cmd/serve.go`**: Implemented a basic web server to display tasks.

## Files Modified/Created
- `go.mod`, `go.sum` - Updated with new dependencies.
- `main.go` - Initialized config and plugins.
- `Makefile` - Updated `LDFLAGS` for version injection.
- `cmd/root.go` - Added new subcommands and exported `RootCmd`.
- `cmd/notify.go` - Created notification command.
- `cmd/serve.go` - Created web server command.
- `cmd/version.go` - Created version command.
- `cmd/calendar/root.go` - Created calendar root command.
- `cmd/calendar/import.go` - Implemented gcal and ics import.
- `cmd/calendar/list.go` - Implemented calendar list command.
- `cmd/calendar/sync.go` - Implemented calendar sync command.
- `cmd/display/root.go` - Created display root command.
- `cmd/display/table.go` - Implemented table display command.
- `cmd/task/add.go` - Added `--due-date` flag.
- `cmd/task/prioritize.go` - Implemented task prioritization logic.
- `cmd/task/schedule.go` - Implemented task scheduling logic.
- `internal/config/config.go` - Added calendar storage path.
- `internal/gcal/gcal.go` - Implemented gcal TSV parsing.
- `internal/ics/ics.go` - Implemented ICS parsing.
- `internal/plugin/plugin.go` - Defined plugin interface and registry.
- `internal/plugins/hello/hello.go` - Created dummy hello plugin.
- `internal/storage/storage.go` - Added calendar event storage functions.
- `internal/table/table.go` - Implemented task table rendering.
- `pkg/version/version.go` - Defined version variables.

## Tests Added
- Manual testing of all implemented commands and features.

## Configuration Changes
- Added `calendar.storage.path` to the configuration.

## Documentation Updates
- This session summary.

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of clear `IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `README.md` files for guiding development.
- The flexibility of `cobra` for building complex CLIs.
- The utility of `promptui` for interactive terminal experiences.
- The challenges of integrating external tools and adapting their logic.

## Known Issues/TODOs
- The `test` task appearing in the table is a leftover from previous testing and should be cleaned up.
- The web interface is very basic and lacks full CRUD operations, authentication, and a proper frontend framework.
- The plugin architecture is simplified (internal registration) and does not support dynamic loading of external binaries.

## Next Steps
- Implement full CRUD operations for the web interface.
- Explore dynamic loading for the plugin architecture.
- Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Implement the remaining advanced features (e.g., full notification system, more advanced scheduling).
