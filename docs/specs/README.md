- [ ] **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing task workflows
- [ ] **Add comprehensive tests** for task operations
- [ ] **Update documentation** for integrated commands

### Phase 3: Calendar Integration (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] **Integrate gcalcli-to-yaml** as calendar import subcommand
- [ ] **Integrate ics-to-yaml** as alternative import method
- [ ] **Create unified calendar model** that works with task system
- [ ] **Implement calendar-to-task conversion** workflows
- [ ] **Add calendar viewing and filtering** capabilities

### Phase 4: Data Visualization (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] **Integrate tasks-table** as display subcommand
- [ ] **Add flexible output formats** (table, JSON, YAML, CSV)
- [ ] **Implement custom column selection** and sorting
- [ ] **Create dashboard-style views** for productivity metrics
- [ ] **Add export capabilities** for external tools

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Priority: Low)
- [ ] **Task scheduling** based on calendar events
- [ ] **Smart task prioritization** using calendar context
- [ ] **Notification system** for due dates and reminders
- [ ] **Plugin architecture** for custom extensions
- [ ] **Web interface** for remote task management

## ðŸ“‹ AI Agent Instructions

### Getting Started
1. **Review existing tools** in `../tools/` directory to understand current functionality
2. **Analyze code patterns** and identify common interfaces for integration
3. **Create initial project structure** following the architecture above
4. **Start with Phase 1** foundation work before integrating specific tools

### Development Priorities
1. **Preserve existing functionality** - Users depend on current task-cli features
2. **Maintain interactive UX** - Keep the enhanced terminal experience (screen clearing, responsive sizing, text truncation)
3. **Use consistent patterns** - Establish coding standards early and apply throughout
4. **Test thoroughly** - Each integration should maintain or improve existing capabilities

### Integration Strategy
- **Incremental migration** - Move tools one at a time to minimize disruption
- **Backward compatibility** - Ensure existing workflows continue to work
- **Unified commands** - Create logical command hierarchy (e.g., `taskflow task list`, `taskflow calendar import`)
- **Shared configuration** - Consolidate settings into single configuration system

### Quality Standards
- **Interactive mode must remain responsive** and professional
- **All text output must handle terminal width** with truncation
- **Screen clearing should work consistently** across all platforms
- **Error handling must be comprehensive** with helpful messages
- **Documentation should be thorough** with examples

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing tool functionality preserved
- [ ] Unified CLI with consistent interface
- [ ] Enhanced cross-tool integration features
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Professional documentation and examples
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility maintained

## ðŸ”„ Migration Notes

The existing tools are fully functional and in production use. The integration should be done carefully to ensure no regression in functionality or user experience. The enhanced interactive mode features (screen clearing, responsive sizing, text truncation) are particularly important to preserve as they represent significant UX improvements.

Priority should be given to maintaining the existing task management workflow while gradually adding calendar integration and visualization capabilities.
